# Leloutama
A multi-threaded webserver, written entirely in PHP.

### Requirements
* PHP version >= 7, and a thread safe build
* The [pthreads](https://github.com/krakjoe/pthreads) extension for PHP.

# GO FIGURE THIS YOURSELF
*Pfft, nah, I'm going to do this in a while... I am lazy that's all*

## TODO
* Implement doc-blocks (v1.3.1)
* Implement SSL (v1.3.1)
* Do the README (v.1.3.1)
* (...And more stuffs...)

## Why should you use it?
* Supports HTTP Caching
* Supports middleware in the form of extensions
* Supports dynamic URL (thanks to FastRoute)
* Supports GET, HEAD, and POST
* No need to download additional servers, just PHP
* etc...

## Drawbacks

* Currently, doesn't have much features.
* The codebase is un-documented.
* Many HTTP header's are yet to be utilised.
* No SSL/TLS support.
